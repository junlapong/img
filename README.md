## Ideas

1. Sign in with google account
2. Upload image to goole drive with public access grant
3. Then

replace this URL from the address bar:

    http://docs.google.com/file/d/FILEID/edit

with:

    http://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=FILEID

(where FILEID is a long sequence of digits and letters).

This only works if you've changed the visibility options to "__public on the Web__" or "__anyone with the link__" in the Share dialog.
